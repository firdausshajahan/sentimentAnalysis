1705,Rce Sept,"apology to write my comment here, as when I am sending email, my email come back to me. Complain on DRIVER MUHAMMAD AZIADI BIN SHUKRI JML7263                                                                                 To  whom it may concern,I would like to write a complain with regards to earlier incident.  One of  your driver was misbehaving just now, and also overcharged me. Instead of charging 7rm, he didnt return any change to me.  This is the story; from Citysquare to our apartment at M'tiara Jalan Idaman Utama, when the grab was about to reach, I asked him a favour if he coulddrop me at Block B. (I am a frequent passenger of your company, as I travel to Singapore everyday for work and normally I dont ask the driver to drop me at our block if I dont carry heavy things as I am well aware that service rendered is only until designated location). But due to heavy things that I am carrying, and it was raining as well, I asked him if he could drop me at Block B. He started to nag/shout and tell that I am just paying 7rm . ( in a rudely manner). Well, he can simply asked me to add if he is not happy of a 7rm, or better yet to cancel my booking if he is not satisfied of the charges. (He was the first driver who did this) Normally if drivers dont want to drop us then no issues, but to yell on me and talk to me many things? I felt it shouldnt be the way. He started to maneuver his car facing to the guard house and ask where is the block B, and when I told him he said, wait! why cannot wait! So I felt irritated. As a driver, he can simply ask me where is my block as I am the passenger and I know better where I am heading. While his car was travelling heading to my block arguments was going on because he started to belittle my 7rm. He was shouting and telling that I am just paying 7rm and all nonsense words, until he use Bulgar words bringing my Mom in the middle. (Mother f*****) Shame on him I know as a muslim shouldnt utter those words esp if you are fasting! Really I lost my patience when I hear those words from his mouth and my entire body was shivering. I am very sorry but I couldn't take it, I was simply asking him a favour and why until to that extent that he needs to shout on me. Reaching below our block, my husband was there (because I told him to come downstairs to help me carry my things) my husband was wondering whats going on, until this driver come out from his car and wanted to fight with my husband. From below our block he started yelling until the guardhouse area, provoking us to meet him at the police station. Seriously, I dont understand what happened with him, this is the first time that I encountered this kind of person/grab driver.  Most of the drivers that I encountered were so kind and polite.I am not writing this complain to take people's rice bowl, I am doing this so no other passengers will experience the same thing that I experienced.As human being, whatever race, religion you are, deserves RESPECT.  We as a passengers deserve respect and vice versa. In fact I dont treat grab drivers as drivers, they are consider heroes, because they use their own cars leave their family as well to make a  living esp this fasting season. But I am just so much disappointed to how this person behaves. Attached herewith are the evidence photos of his car number and a snap of his face to proved that he went out from his car wanting to fight with my husband while my husband was taking a photo of his car number. We've already complained to the help desk a few minutes ago, and this is the second complain so I can send the photos as per help desk advice.

After I received the e-receipt, I have contacted the Grab Customer Service Hotline 1300. Felicia is the first agent who picked up my case asked me about the exact toll fare, I mentioned too I dont remember but definitely need no RM14.00. And she said Grab team will investigate the route and also the fare of tolls will revert to me within a 3 -5 working days (WITHIN). But after then I did not receive any call back from Grab. No emails, no follow up. Nothing at all. And on 20th August, I called back, they said no one is picking up my case. My case already left behind. So what now?

Felicia is the first agent who picked up my case asked me about the exact toll fare, I mentioned too I dont remember but definitely need no RM14.00. And she said Grab team will investigate the route and also the fare of tolls will revert to me within a 3 -5 working days (WITHIN). But after then I did not receive any call back from Grab. No emails, no follow up. Nothing at all. And on 20th August, I called back, they said no one is picking up my case. My case already left behind. So what now?
