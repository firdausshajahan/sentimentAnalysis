Mokhtar Stork,"GRAB has become disgusting. Yesterday, I took a Grab car from the Sentul Rail Station. Instead of going through Sentul Market and onto the highway to my house at Taman Sering Ukay/Ukay Perdana, I was taken for a sightseeing ride and via Akleh and had to pay RM35 plus toll! God damn it man....this is robbery! I have lodged a complaint, still no answer. GRAB has become disgusting. Yesterday, I took a Grab car from the Sentul Rail Station.

Mokhtar Stork,"I find you amazing. You have my records and details. You even sent me a receipt for my journey which is now missing. However, my phone record on my journey states Booking ID: ADR-1975631-9-017 cost RM35. By the way, when I question the driver he said that GRAB determines the best journey, not him.

Carmen Ong,"On 26th July 2019, I have booked a Grab from Sungai Buloh to Sungai Besi. I am using Grab Credit to make payment, and they have actually charged me RM14.00 for 3 tolls and it has auto deducted from my account. After I received the e-receipt, I have contacted the Grab Customer Service Hotline 1300. Felicia is the first agent who picked up my case asked me about the exact toll fare, I mentioned too I dont remember but definitely need no RM14.00. And she said Grab team will investigate the route and also the fare of tolls will revert to me within a 3 -5 working days (WITHIN). But after then I did not receive any call back from Grab. No emails, no follow up. Nothing at all. And on 20th August, I called back, they said no one is picking up my case. My case already left behind. So what now?

Elena Almeida,"You really need to do something about your drivers accepting the booking then texting to say that they can't come and ask the passenger to cancel. Can't even complain about this on your grab help page. Annoying that this frequently happens, and the passenger is charged a few and we have to go through the trouble of asking for a refund in a process you make so difficult.
