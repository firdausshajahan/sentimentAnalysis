Kc Khoo,"Grab, wanna complain about my last Grab trip. First driver asked me to cancel because he missed the junction. Then I booked again and you increased the fare. And what was wrong with you to make me wait for more than 10 minutes while the app showed the waiting time was 4 minutes??!!Higher fare with longer waiting time.
